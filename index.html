            <h2>Story 1</h2>
            
            <p>Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson: This is How to Save a Planet. I'm Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson.</p>

            <p>Alex Blumberg: And I'm Alex Blumberg. And this is the podcast about what we need to do to address the
                climate crisis, and how to make those things happen.</p>

            <p>Ayana: So there's this question we get from a lot of listeners, and one listener in particular summed it
                up perfectly. She wrote in to ask us to settle an argument.</p>

            <p>Anna: Hi, Ayana and Alex. My name is Anna, and I love your podcast. I just listened to the episode about
                which type of car is better for the environment, and I was wondering if you could weigh in on another
                debate. So my brother and I, we agree on a lot of things, but one topic that we always argue about is
                individual versus systemic, policy-based change.</p>

            <p>Alex: Oh, this debate.</p>

            <p>Ayana: This debate.</p>

            <p>Alex: How much do our individual actions actually matter when it comes to climate change, versus how much
                is it all about big systems and policies sort of beyond our individual control? Like, how important is
                it to look at how sustainably sourced our sweatpants are, or how important is it to go deep into the
                weeds on which LED light is best for the climate, or that sort of thing.</p>
                

            <p>Ayana: Yeah, and Anna says her brother thinks none of that stuff is actually gonna get us out of the
                climate crisis. That climate change is a huge, systemic problem, and the only way to fix it is with big,
                systemic solutions.</p>

            <p>Alex: But Anna says in her voicemail, she's not so sure about that.</p>

            <p>Anna: I know that we're not gonna recycle and bike and beyond burger our way out of climate change, but I
                do have a slightly more optimistic view that individual consumer choices can make a difference. So am I
                just a sucker, or can individuals actually do something?</p>

            <p>Alex: So we focus a lot on this show on big-picture solutions.</p>

            <p>Ayana: Yeah.</p>

            <p>Alex: Things like government policies to limit climate-harming refrigerants, or things that we can do to
                increase renewable power or change how we farm.</p>

            <p>Ayana: But we know&mdash;because you tell us&mdash;that a lot of you are wondering, what should I be
                doing as an individual in my daily life? And do those individual actions even matter?</p>

            <p>Alex: One listener even told us about a spreadsheet he made tallying up all his family's actions.</p>

            <p>Ayana: I love a spreadsheet!</p>

            <p>Alex: And the associated carbon footprint of each action, sort of like trying to winnow their footprint
                down. And another one of our listeners, this listener named Mark wrote, &quot;Is there just one thing
                that would make a real impact? Maybe cutting out cheese or something?&quot; Oh, Mark. [laughs]</p>

            <p>Ayana: [laughs] Oh Mark, if only it were that simple.</p>

            <p>Alex: On today's episode, we are going to dive into this debate between Anna and her brother: do
                individual actions even matter? And if so, which ones are the most important? That's all coming up after
                the break. Although spoiler alert: cutting out cheese is not at the top of the list. Sorry, Mark.</p>

            <p>Ayana: Which is really unfortunate, because I'm allergic to cheese. So if that were the answer, I'm a
                frickin' angel.</p>

            <p>Alex: You'd be even more of an eco-angel, than you already are.</p>

            <p>Ayana: I've never eaten cheese in my entire life. All right. Stick around.</p>
